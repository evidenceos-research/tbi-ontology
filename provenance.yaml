  abbott_i_stat_tbi_plasma:
    platform: "Abbott i-STAT TBI Plasma Test"
    analytes: [GFAP, UCH-L1]
    regulatory_clearance: "FDA 510(k) K203170"
    use_case: "Acute CT triage in mild TBI within intended sample window"
    notes: "Canonical runtime thresholds in this stack are bound to this clearance context"

  biomerieux_vidas_tbi:
    platform: "bioMerieux VIDAS TBI"
    analytes: [GFAP, UCH-L1]
    regulatory_clearance: "FDA 510(k) (2024)"
    use_case: "Lab-based/near-point-of-care biomarker-supported triage"
    notes: "Platform included for provenance completeness; site-specific cutoffs should be validated before hard binding"

  simoa_quanterix:
    platform: "Quanterix Simoa HD-X / SR-X"
    analytes: [GFAP, UCH-L1, NfL, total_tau, p-tau-217, S100B]
    regulatory_clearance: "Research Use Only (RUO); CE-IVD for select assays in EU"
    use_case: "Ultrasensitive research biomarker quantification; clinical study biobanking"
    notes: >
      Most published NfL and tau kinetics data in TBI literature derived from Simoa platform.
      Sub-pg/mL sensitivity enables detection of mild TBI biomarker elevations.
      Not a point-of-care device — requires laboratory infrastructure.

  elecsys_roche:
    platform: "Roche Elecsys / cobas"
    analytes: [NfL, p-tau-217]
    regulatory_clearance: "CE-IVD (EU); FDA submission pathway in progress for select analytes"
    use_case: "High-throughput clinical laboratory neurodegeneration biomarker panel"
    notes: >
      p-tau-217 on Elecsys has shown high concordance with PET amyloid/tau imaging.
      Emerging TBI-specific validation. Primary use is neurodegeneration screening.
