# AGE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE RANGES
# Scaffold for pediatric, adult, and geriatric thresholds
# Status: research — insufficient published data for most analytes
# =============================================================================
age_specific_ranges:
  _note: >
    Age-specific reference ranges are critical for clinical implementation
    but remain poorly characterized in the literature for most TBI biomarkers.
    GFAP and UCH-L1 have emerging pediatric data from TRACK-TBI Pilot Peds.
    NfL has well-established age-dependent norms in the neurodegeneration
    literature that must be accounted for in TBI interpretation.

      Rising NfL at day 14 correlates with TAPVI burden and worse 6-month GOSE.
      Failure of NfL to decline by month 3 suggests ongoing neurodegeneration.
